## 99 Ways To DI

I originally gave this talk with the alternative title "99 Ways To DI",
a reference to the Megadeth track "99 Ways To Die"
(a favorite track of mine in my youth).
I included several images of Megadeth lead singer/guitarist Dave Mustaine.
I've removed these images in this version of the slides
